<p>These pics aren't from the concert I went to, but that's OK.  Scott did have 
on that same outfit, though.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to go to the STP concert in New Haven on December 1st 
and it was amazing!  Two hours (twenty-four songs) of pure listening enjoyment.
They played songs from all three albums: Core, Purple, and Tiny Music.</p>
<p>These were the songs they played:</p>
<pre>-Pop's Love Suicide  -Dancing Days       -Interstate Love Song
-Crackerman          -Creep              -Lounge Fly
-Meatplow            -Pretty Penny       -Lady Picture Show
-Tumble In The Rough -Seven Caged Tigers -Unglued
-Vasoline            -Trippin' On A Hole -ENCORE-
-Still Remains         In A Paper Heart  -Big Bang Baby
-Silvergun Superman  -Plush              -Dead And Bloated
-Wicked Garden       -Piece Of Pie       -Sex Type Thing
-Daisy               -Big Empty</pre>
<p>While Dean and Rob played "Daisy", a circular stage was lowered from the
 ceiling containing instruments for an acoustic set, which contained "Dancing 
Days", "Creep", "Pretty Penny", and "Seven Caged Tigers".  For songs that used 
a distotred bacground voice, like "Crackerman", Scott sang into a megaphone.  
Rob sang backup vocals in "Creep."  It was great.</p>
<p>The visual effects were also great.  Behind the band was a huge domed 
screen that showed slides and video clips.  Sometimes there were disco balls
going and at others there were colored spotlights.  It seemed like there was 
always colored smoke.  At the end of the show, during "Big Bang Baby", 
hundreds of balloons dropped from the ceiling.<p/> 
<center>The entire show was terrific!</center>  
<center>It gets five stars on the Rachel meter.</center>

<p><b>STP Future Touring Info:</b>  Yup, it looks like STP is going to go on tour 
again!  This quote comes directly from Scott (maybe) during an AOL auditorium 
chat:  "Right now we are booking dates for the second week in April.  It will 
take us out for six weeks and that will be secondary markets and cities across 
the country.....Then we will take three weeks off and doing a big major market 
summer tour for twelve weeks."</p>
