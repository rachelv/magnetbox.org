Rolling Stone/AOL MC:     Good evening and welcome to AOL LIVE, Scott 
			  Weiland!

Scott Weiland:     Hello everyone.

Question:     How are you feeling?

Scott Weiland:     I'm feeling great. I just wrote a song today. I'm trying 
	           to hack away on the guitar.

Question:     Are you going back on tour?

Scott Weiland:     Yeah, right now we are booking dates for the second week 
		   in April. It will take us out for 6 weeks into secondary 
		   markets and cities across the country. Basically, places 
		   you would think would tend to be located near lead paint 
		   factories. Then we will take three weeks off and do a big 
		   major market summer tour for 12 weeks.

Question:     Are you working on any new songs?

Scott Weiland:     I've written four songs in the last two weeks and recorded
		   three of them. One is called "Desperation No. 5" and the 
		   other two are nameless so far. They might be for later 
		   when STP takes a break for awhile to do their solo things. 
		   Everyone in the band is totally supportive of each other's
		   side projects because it they are necessary in order to 
		   keep the band together. 

Question:     What bands do YOU like to listen to?

Scott Weiland:     The last three Beatles records right now. Also, David 
		   Bowie's "Scary Monsters" and "Hunky Dory." I'm also 
		   looking forward to hearing the new Red Kross record which 
		   Robert helped produce. And I can't seem to get the last PJ
		   Harvey disc out of my car for some reason.

Question:     How did your second album get its name "Purple"?

Scott Weiland:     It just sounded that way to us.

Question:     What events led up to your entrance into rehab?

Scott Weiland:     That would have to be my over interest in elicit drug use,
		   obviously. Drugs don't work anymore for me.

Question:     I live in Vancouver. What was the deal with the cancelled show?

Scott Weiland:     Well, there was a major snowstorm -- they cancelled all 
		   the major flights into the city. We were going to fly and 
		   do the show but they would not let any planes land.

Question:     What do you say to your fans who do not believe your sobriety?

Scott Weiland:     I don't know. I don't really have anything to say. You 
		   believe in what you believe in. I'm really not asking 
		   anyone to believe anything. If you like the band, then 
		   believe in the music. That's the main thing. I'm not 
		   quitting alcohol or drugs for the fans' sake. I'm doing 
		   it because its the only option there is left for me to 
		   live a good life.

Question:     What changes are you making (or planning to make) to ensure 
	      that you don't have another relapse?

Scott Weiland:     Taking it on a day-to-day basis. Take each day one day at
		   a time and try to enjoy the journey.

Question:     Do you feel that you are ever gonna be able to kick your 
	      demons?

Scott Weiland:     Of course I'd like to think I will be able to [kick them] 
		   forever, but I cannot look at it that way. Right now, 
		   there are no drugs in my body, but plenty of songs in my 
		   head. That's where I'm at today.

Question:     A "loyal fan in Middle Village, New York" wants to know where 
	      you get your ideas for your songs?

Scott Weiland:     From a lot of things -- just everyday life. Some of the
		   heavier based lyrics come from my own personal experiences
		   and observations of other things. Whether that be social 
		   or sexual or political or politically sexual or whatever. 
		   I actually just wrote a song today about my dogs, but you 
		   would never know it.

Question:     About how long did it take to write and record "Purple and were
	      any of those songs written prior to "Core"?

Scott Weiland:     We wrote a lot of the songs on "Purple" while on tour for 
		   "Core." When we actually started going to tape, it took 
		   about a month and a half to get it all down. The main riff
		   on "Vasoline" was originally from a song when we still 
		   called "Mighty Joe Young" and had been playing in clubs 
		   in Hollywood.

Question:     Are you planning to tour in New York again? It was awesome when
	      you came onstage with Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith.

Scott Weiland:     Yeah, we may hit one of the secondary cities in the state 
		   in April or May. And maybe Jones Beach on the summer tour.

Question:     Scott, which album is your favorite?

Scott Weiland:     At the moment "Tiny Music" because we pushed hard to break
		   new ground sonically.

Question:     Have you been approached about Lollapalooza? And would you do 
	      it?

Scott Weiland:     We have not been approached about it. I ran into Perry the
		   other night and we talked a while, but it wasn't about 
		   Lollapalooza. But I wouldn't mind if the package looked
		   appealing -- if Lollapalooza had bands we were into 
		   touring with and seeing play every night.

Question:     What was the inspiration for the song "Naked Sunday?"

Scott Weiland:     I think that was all about being in my early twenties, 
		   young and politically self-righteous. Basically being 
		   young and full of angst and being angry at everything 
		   around me, including the government and my old beat-up 
		   pick-up truck that wouldn't start every other day.

Question:     What made you decide to paint your nails?

Scott Weiland:     I was copying Keith Richards.

Question:     How did you feel about Rolling Stone's article on you and your 
	      band? How did you feel about the controversial article in 
	      Rolling Stone on Eddie Vedder? 

Scott Weiland:     I found it disturbingly ironic that we were on the cover 
		   of Rolling Stone at the exact same time that Pearl Jam 
		   were on the cover of Spin. RS's Pearl Jam story -- I don't 
		   know . . . when you're a person in the public eye and 
		   controversy seems to follow you where ever you go. And 
		   when there's not any, people feel the need to create some. 
		   I would prefer to see my name out of the controversy 
		   files for the remainder of 1997. That would be nice. I 
		   knew our piece would be all about drugs and not about the
		   music if I didn't tell my story of what happened -- if I 
		   didn't tell it, then someone would have made it up on 
		   their own.

Question:     Are you gonna do anymore work with the Magnificent Bastards?

Scott Weiland:     Yeah, I'm sure I will but right now, keeping one four 
		   piece rock band together is enough of a head trip at
		   times.

Question:     Will you put out a live video or tape of this past tour? It 
	      was great.

Scott Weiland:     As far as extra-curricular STP activity -- I'll just put
		   out my own record so I only have to deal with one ego and 
		   not 3 whole new personalities. Yeah, there will be a live 
		   compilation coming out from all three tours.

Question:     The change between "Core" to the present album is incredible. 
	      Do you ever see the band directing itself more towards the 
	      harder edge of "Core"? 

Scott Weiland:     Yeah, I think where the four of us are at right now and 
		   our direction musically for the next record, we are all 
		   together unanimous on the idea of putting out an album 
		   that regresses in a direction of us being a live, powerul,
       		   four-piece rock band and less in the arty, experimental
		   direction of the last two records.

Question:     Of all the years you have been with the band, which has been 
	      the most enjoyable and why?

Scott Weiland:     Well, its different. There were great moments that happen 
		   any time we are together. I would have to say, my favorite
		   times were back in the beginning and we were touring 
		   around and driving around in campers and playing small 
		   clubs. But this last tour in the fall really had some 
		   beautiful moments on it as well. We weren't focusing on 
		   partying every night, we were focusing on playing the best
		   shows we could play 5 out of 7 nights a week.

RS/AOL MC:     Scott Weiland, thank you for joining us and taking our 
	       questions. It was a pleasure.

Scott Weiland:     Thanks.
