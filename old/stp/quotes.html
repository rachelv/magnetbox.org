<h2>Scott</h2>
<p><b>On the sound of "Purple":</b>   "We try to display a very intense 
musical and emotional power, but that doesn't mean playing as loudly and 
heavily as we can from the first song to the last.  We don't want to sound 
just one way; we like to paint different soundscapes and create different 
moods.  It's not just 'Plug in, crank up to ten, let's rock.'  Our music 
has more sides to it."</p>

<p><b>On seeing his real father backstage during a US tour in 
the summer of '94:</b>   "After all these years of denying I had this other 
life, seeing him, and hearing him say that he is so proud of me, triggered 
these emotions that I had never dealt with.  I completely broke down and 
didn't know why I was hysterical.  I actually called my mother to seek 
solitude in her words."<p/>

<p><b>On his taste in music as a kid:</b>   "Myself, I really didn't 
get into the whole rock thing.  My parents didn't wean me on Cream or Hendrix.  
The first record I ever bought as a kid was 'The Captain And Tenille's 
Greatest Hits'!"</p>

<p><b>Explaining both his lyrics and "Sex Type Thing":</b>   "My 
lyrics aren't messages, they're more like cause and effect.  'Sex Type Thing' 
is written from the point of view of your bar-room mentality person, maybe 
gone a little wild.  It deals with the typical male ideas about sex - that if 
you arouse me it's my right to have my way with you.  If you wear that, if 
you go out looking like that it means you wanna get fucked."</p>

<h2>Dean</h2>
<p><b>Explaining the lyrics to "Sex Type Thing" which had caused such 
an uproar:</b>   "Don't ask me why, but so many people look up to those in our 
situation.  We're all just real tired of how women are fucking perceived and 
treated around, especially in the United States.  It's just something that 
really weighs on Weiland's head, as well as the rest of the band.  I don't 
think we wanted to come out and make a statement, that's how we wrote the song 
the way we did.  The way the song was done, Weiland put himself in that first 
position where he was speaking from behind the eyes of that fucked-up person.  
I think the way he approached that was very, very cool."</p>

<p><b>On the allegations that STP was a Pearl Jam clone:</b>   
"All the way.  We totally are.  It was meant to be like this.  Hopefully, 
their career will keep going, so yours will keep going too.  But who fucking 
gives a shit if you like the record, man.  If you do and you tell me you like it 
and that's your honest thing, great.  If you tell me you don't like it, and 
that's your honest thing..... Anybody who thinks everybody's going to like 
everything has got a fucking problem.  The press is responsible for a lot 
of things that have brought a lot of cynicism on artisis."</p>

<h2>Rob</h2>
<p><b>On the media's reaction to "Core":</b>   "I didn't think a lot of things 
would be the way they are.  We,ve definitely got a bad taste in our mouths 
over the past two years since 'Core' came out.  I've gotten to the point where 
I think rock music is pretty damn silly.  People look into it too much.  The 
position we're in, it's like we're open targets for anything.  I don't expect 
everyone to like what we're doing, but don't insult out intelligence.  People 
don't even know who you are and they're making ignorant comments about things, 
like all these comparisons.  I used to do that in third grade."</p>

<p><b>On the band's relationship to the Seattle scene:</b>   "People get so 
shallow, thinking that you grabbed your influences from the bands that are 
out now.  Wouldn't anybody stop to think that we're all the same age and we all 
grew up on the same kind of fucking music?"</p>
<hr>
<h2>Eric</h2>
<p><b>On the band's rise to fame:</b>   "The thing is it was bands like 
Jane's Addiction who started the whole alternative scene.  Bands that didn't 
have radio play, that didn't have MTV play, bands that had just developed a 
large following by the time they did get on MTV.  America was sick of 90-pound 
hairdos, you know?  So we must have drawn people because of bands like Pearl 
Jam making the alternative scene popular, but I can't say how many.  No matter 
where you're from there's good music coming from everywhere around the country.  
In New York, in Minneapolis, in Chicago.  This thing about us coming from 
San Diego has gotten blown out of all proportion.  You're gonna write good music 
wherever you're from.  It's not the molecules in the air that influence you."</p>

<p><b>On Scott's drug dependency:</b>   "We talked to him alot about it.  
It's just that certain individuals are individuals.  You can't say nothing to 
nobody.  It's up to them.  It's just hard when you're under pressure and you're 
trying to record and you're upset with someone..... It kind of makes you not 
want to talk to them.  Some people have problems and deficiencies, some 
people don't.  I have problems and dependencies too.  They can be just as 
painful and dangerous.  They're just not the same as Scott's.  We all have to 
release ourselves in different ways."</p>
