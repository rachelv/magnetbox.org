                <ul>
                    <li>Acted as the primary point of contact between the larger REI organization and the Adventure Projects team. Made Adventure Projects data available to and discoverable by teams that needed it, established standardized ways to share this data between two separate stacks, ensured Adventure Projects sites met REI's SEO and accessibility guidelines, and generally coordinated the engineering side of all projects involving <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rei.com/">rei.com</a>.</li>
                    <li>Worked to develop a more collaborative engineering culture as the Adventure Projects team grew to five engineers. Efforts included using PRs for increased team visibility into code changes, holding regular engineering meetings for both free-form topics and architecture reviews, instituting epic owners in Jira to promote code ownership by ICs, and encouraging 10% time for prototyping and experimentation.</li>

                        <li>Created a mature, timestamp-based sync API to sync data between the web and mobile apps, reducing the time to sync items for users with thousands of data points by an order of magnitude.</li>
                        <!-- <li>photo perf? re-optimize, header setting across cloudfront and s3 </li> -->
                    </ul>
                    <li>Transformed the development process from one that only supported one engineer to one that could support a team, including moving all code to github, provisioning local &amp; staging development environments, creating a continuous deployment process, and setting up monitoring & observability systems.</li>
                    <li>Guided the transformation of 10+ year old spaghetti code into modern web apps. Chose an MVC framework, rearchitected supporting components as necessary, refactored frontend code into templates, and integrated frontend and backend build systems to create a codebase that other engineers could work on enjoyably.</li>
